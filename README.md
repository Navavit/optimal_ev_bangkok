# 🚩 EV Station Placement Optimization (Bangkok Case Study)

An advanced geospatial analysis project designed to identify and prioritize optimal locations for new Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations in Bangkok. This project integrates **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**, **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, and **Integer Programming (Optimization)** to ensure strategic placement that maximizes benefit while avoiding redundancy with existing infrastructure.

## 💡 Inspiration
This project is inspired by the conceptual framework and codebase of [Aditya9111/optimal_charging_location](https://github.com/Aditya9111/optimal_charging_location). It adapts the core logic for the Thailand context, integrating dynamic population density data from Google Earth Engine and implementing a specific "Existing Station Exclusion" constraint to ensure urban planning efficiency.

## 📐 Mathematical Models & Equations

The project utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) principles combined with mathematical optimization:

### 1. Distance Calculation (Haversine Formula)
To calculate the shortest distance between two points on the Earth's surface (Great-circle distance), ensuring higher accuracy than Euclidean distance:

$$
d = 2R \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)}\right)
$$

* **R**: Earth's radius (6,371 km)
* **$\phi, \lambda$**: Latitude and Longitude in radians

### 2. Neighbourhood Score
Evaluates the potential of a candidate site $j$ within a 0.5 km radius using a Weighted Sum Model based on Points of Interest (POI):

$$
S_j = (\alpha \cdot P_j) + (\beta \cdot Q_j) + (\gamma \cdot R_j) + (\delta \cdot S_j)
$$

* **$P, Q, R, S$**: Counts of Restaurants, Fuel Stations, Malls, and Apartments.
* **Weights**: $\alpha=1.5, \beta=2.0, \gamma=1.2, \delta=0.8$

### 3. Benefit Score
Combines physical infrastructure potential with social demand (Population Density) extracted from GEE satellite data:

$$
\text{Benefit}_j = (0.5 \times \text{Population}_j) + (10 \times S_j)
$$

### 4. Integer Programming Optimization
Utilizes the `PuLP` library to select the best sites through a binary decision variable $y_j \in \{0, 1\}$.

**Objective Function:**

$$
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{j \in J} (f_j \cdot y_j) - \sum_{j \in J} (\text{Benefit}_j \cdot y_j)
$$

*(The model aims to minimize installation costs $f_j$ while maximizing the total Benefit Score.)*

**Constraints:**
* **Spatial Exclusion:** If distance $d(j, \text{existing}) < 0.5$ km, then $y_j = 0$ (Prevents clustering near existing stations).
* **Min Station Supply:** $\sum_{j \in J} y_j \ge 50$ (Ensures at least 50 new stations are recommended).

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
pip install osmnx geemap earthengine-api geopandas pulp shapely branca folium

```

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**: Fetches POIs via OSMnx and Population Density (GPWv4) via Google Earth Engine.
2. **Spatial Scoring**: Computes the Neighbourhood Score for all potential candidates (parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
3. **Conflict Checking**: Identifies existing EV stations from OSM to create "Protection Buffers."
4. **Optimization**: Runs the Linear Programming solver to find the optimal set of locations that satisfies all constraints.
5. **Visualization**: Generates an interactive Folium map with toggleable layers and color-coded Suitability Scores.

## 🗺 Visualization Layers

* **Population Heatmap**: Global population density (White  Red).
* **Unselected Candidates**: Potential sites that were not prioritized by the model (Gray).
* **Existing Stations**: Current EV infrastructure from OSM (Purple).
* **Optimal Sites**: Recommended new locations (Color-coded by Benefit Score from Red to Green).

## 🚀 Usage

1. Set your GEE Project ID in `ee.Initialize(project='your-project-id')`.
2. Define the target area in `place_name` (e.g., "Bangkok, Thailand").
3. Execute the script; the interactive map will be displayed automatically in your notebook environment.
